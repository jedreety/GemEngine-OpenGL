# GemEngine - OpenGL Game Engine and Minecraft Clone

**GemEngine** is a project started in early October. I aim to update it frequently. For now it is in early developement.

## Project Description

**GemEngine** is an OpenGL-based game engine tailored for developing voxel-based games, with a primary focus on creating a **multiplayer Minecraft clone**. I strive to make it as efficient as possible.

### Minecraft Clone Game

Utilizing **GemEngine**, this project aims to develop a **multiplayer Minecraft clone** with a medieval theme, enhanced combat mechanics, and improved scenes:

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Dynamically creates diverse landscapes, ensuring each playthrough offers a unique environment.
- **Player Interaction**: Allows players to interact with the world through actions such as building, mining, and crafting.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Enables multiple players to connect to a shared server, fostering collaborative construction and social gameplay.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures smooth gameplay experiences through efficient rendering and resource management.

### Purpose

The primary goal of **GemEngine** is to create a high-quality game engine and realize my dream of developing an engaging multiplayer Minecraft clone.
