# GemEngine - OpenGL Game Engine and Minecraft Clone

**GemEngine** is a robust, OpenGL-based game engine designed to facilitate the creation of immersive 3D applications and games. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, GemEngine offers a solid foundation for developers aiming to craft complex, performance-driven projects.

## Project Description

**GemEngine** is an OpenGL-based game engine tailored for developing voxel-based games, with a primary focus on creating a **multiplayer Minecraft clone**. The engine is built to support high-performance rendering, efficient world management, and seamless multiplayer interactions, making it an ideal foundation for voxel-driven game development.

### Key Features

- **Modern OpenGL Integration**: Leverages the power of OpenGL for high-performance rendering, enabling realistic graphics and smooth visual experiences.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into distinct modules (e.g., Graphics, Input, Networking) to ensure maintainability and ease of expansion.
- **Voxel-Based World Management**: Implements efficient chunk and chunk generation systems, essential for creating expansive, voxel-driven environments similar to Minecraft.
- **Multiplayer Networking**: Built-in networking capabilities support seamless multiplayer interactions, allowing multiple players to explore and interact within the game world concurrently.
- **Comprehensive Input Handling**: Supports a wide range of input devices, ensuring responsive and intuitive user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to operate seamlessly across major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Minecraft Clone Game

Utilizing **GemEngine**, this project aims to develop a **multiplayer Minecraft clone**, offering players the ability to explore, build, and interact within a procedurally generated voxel world. The game emphasizes:

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Dynamically creates diverse landscapes, ensuring each playthrough offers a unique environment.
- **Block Interaction**: Allows players to place, remove, and interact with various block types, facilitating creative building and exploration.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Enables multiple players to connect to a shared server, fostering collaborative construction and social gameplay.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures smooth gameplay experiences through efficient rendering and resource management, even in large, dynamic worlds.

### Purpose

The primary goal of **GemEngine** is to serve as both an educational tool for understanding game engine development and a practical framework for building feature-rich, voxel-based multiplayer games. By focusing on modular design and leveraging modern graphics technologies, GemEngine empowers developers to create engaging and scalable gaming experiences.
