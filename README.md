# GemEngine - OpenGL Game Engine and Minecraft Clone

**GemEngine** is a project started early Octobre. I will try to update it frequently.

## Project Description

**GemEngine** is an OpenGL-based game engine tailored for developing voxel-based games, with a primary focus on creating a **multiplayer Minecraft clone**. I will try to make it as efficient as possible.

### Minecraft Clone Game

Utilizing **GemEngine**, this project aims to develop a **multiplayer Minecraft clone**, I will try to do a medieval theme with better combat and scenes:

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Dynamically creates diverse landscapes, ensuring each playthrough offers a unique environment.
- **Player Interaction**: Allows players to interact with the world.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Enables multiple players to connect to a shared server, fostering collaborative construction and social gameplay.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures smooth gameplay experiences.

### Purpose

I want to create a good engine and my dream game or something this way.
